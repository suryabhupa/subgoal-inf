This demo shows how HDP-HMMs can fail when the underlying data has state
persistence without some kind of temporal regularization (in the form of a
sticky bias or duration modeling): without setting the number of states to be
the correct number a priori, lots of extra states can be intsantiated.
BUT the effect is much more relevant on real data (when the data doesn't exactly
fit the model). Maybe this demo should use multinomial emissions...
